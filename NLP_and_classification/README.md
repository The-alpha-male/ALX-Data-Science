In this module, we will embark on a journey through the realms of natural language processing `NLP and classification`.
We'll begin by delving into text preprocessing techniques, including `tokenisation`, `stemming`, `lemmatisation`, and `feature`
extraction methods such as bag-of-words and n-grams. We will explore various classification algorithms through
practical implementations, understand their operational mechanisms, and learn how to evaluate their performance
effectively.

From logistic regression and classification metrics to tree-based methods, support vector machines �SVM�, and
neural networks, we'll equip ourselves with a diverse toolkit for tackling real-world classification tasks. Using
model-tuning examples and exercises, we'll gain valuable insights into the iterative process of building and refining
classification models.
