# UN-Data-Manipulation

## Data Science projects

### SQL
SQL is a powerful tool used for data manipulation and retrieval in relational databases, making it a fundamental language for data professionals. Throughout this project, we will explore the core principles of SQL and learn how to query relational databases efficiently, perform data transformations, and gain proficiency in designing complex queries.


## UN Data Manipulation

#### Overview
This project is designed for manipulating and analyzing United Nations (UN) data using Python. The repository includes several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various data manipulation and analysis techniques applied to UN datasets.

#### Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning models (Work in progress)

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Copy code
`git clone https://github.com/The-alpha-male/UN-Data-Manipulation.git`
3. Install the required tools:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - MySQL installer
  - MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE or above
